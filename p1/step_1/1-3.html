      <big>A</big>t the same time, these 
      <span style="font-size: 49px">
      social networks
    </span> 
      tend to treat native text and pictures
    </br>
      — things that are directly posted to them — with a lot more <span style="font-size: 49px">respect</span> than those that reside on outside 
</br>
      web pages.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">One photographer friend explained to me how the images he uploads  directly to Facebook receive a large number
</br>
     of likes, which in turn means they appear more on other people’s news feeds. On the other hand, when he posts a
</br>
      link to the same picture somewhere outside Facebook — his now-dusty blog, for instance — the images are much
</br>
       less visible to Facebook itself, and therefore get far fewer likes. The cycle reinforces itself.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Some networks, like Twitter, treat 
  <span style="font-size: 49px">
    hyperlinks
    </span>
     a little better.
</br>
      Others, insecure social services,are far more paranoid. Instagram — owned by Facebook — doesn’t allow its
</br>
      audiences to leave <span style="font-size: 49px">whatsoever</span>. You can put up a web address alongside your photos, but
</br>
       it won’t go anywhere. 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
Lots of people start the<span style="font-size: 49px">i</span>r daily o<span style="font-size: 49px">n</span>line rou<span style="font-size: 49px">t</span>ine in these cul d<span style="font-size: 49px">e</span>
 sacs of social media, and thei<span style="font-size: 49px">r</span>
   journeys end
</br>
    there. M<span style="font-size: 49px">a</span>ny don’t even realize that they’re using the Internet’s infrastru
  <span style="font-size: 49px">c</span>ture when 
  <span style="font-size: 49px">
    t</span>hey l<span style="font-size: 49px">i</span>ke an Instagram 
</br>

          </span>
           just an app.
But hyperlinks aren’t just
</br>
the skeleton of the web: They are its eyes, 
<span style="font-size: 49px">
a path to
</span>
 its 
 <span style="font-size: 49px">
  soul
</span>. And a blind webpage, one without hyperlinks, can’t look or gaze at another webpage — and this has serious consequences for the dynamics of power on the web.
