At the same time, these social networks tend to treat native text and pictures — things
</h1>
<h1 class="b2">
that are directly posted to them — with a lot more respect than those that reside on
</h1>
<h1 class="b3">
outside web pages. One photographer friend explained to me how the images he uploads
</h1>
<h1 class="b4">
directly to Facebook receive a large number of likes, which in turn means they appear
</h1>
<h1 class="b5">
 more on other people’s news feeds. On the other hand, when he posts a link to the same
</h1>
<h1 class="b6">
 picture somewhere outside Facebook — his now-dusty blog, for instance — the images are
</h1>
<h1 class="b7">
  much less visible to Facebook itself,and therefore get far fewer likes.The cycle reinforces
</h1>
<h1 class="b8">
 itself. Some networks, like Twitter, treat hyperlinks a little better.Others, insecure social</h1>
<h1 class="b9">
 services, are far more paranoid.Instagram—owned by Facebook—doesn’t allow its audiences
</h1>
<h1 class="b10">
 to leave whatsoever. You can put up a web address alongside your photos, but it won’t go
</h1>
<h1 class="b11">
 anywhere. Lots of people start their daily online routine in these cul de sacs offf social
</h1>
<h1 class="b12">
 media,and their journeys end there.Many don’t even realize that they’re using the Internet
</h1>
<h1 class="b13">
infrastructure when they like an Instagram photograph or leave a comment onn a friend’s
</h1>
<h1 class="b14">
Facebook video.It’s just an app. But hyperlinks aren’t just the skeleton
</h1>
<h1 class="b15">
oftheweb:They are its eyes,a path to its soul.And blind webpage,
</h1>
<h1 class="b16">
 one without hyperlinks , can’t loook or gaze at
 </h1>
<h1 class="b17">
  another webpage—and this has very serious 
</h1>
<h1 class="b18">
  consequences for the dynamics
</h1>
<h1 class="b19">
	of power on the
